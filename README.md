# ticket-classification-entity-extraction
A machine learning project to classify support tickets by issue type and urgency level, with entity extraction.

# Customer Support Ticket Classification & Entity Extraction

This project uses machine learning and natural language processing techniques to classify customer support tickets by:
- **Issue Type** (e.g., Login Issue, Payment Problem)
- **Urgency Level** (e.g., Low, Medium, High)

Additionally, it performs **entity extraction** to identify key details like customer names, dates, and products from the ticket descriptions.

## üöÄ Project Highlights
- **Text Preprocessing**: Tokenization, stopword removal, lemmatization.
- **Modeling**: Multi-class classification using ML algorithms.
- **Entity Extraction**: Rule-based and NER approaches.
- **Evaluation**: Accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score metrics.

## üìä Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- SpaCy (for NER)
- Jupyter Notebook
